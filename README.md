Goal of this environment is to make the car reach the top of the mountain. Q-learning algorithm is an implementation of Reinforcement learning, q-learning seeks to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward. It updates a q-table that manages the actions on states. The updates occur after each step or action and ends when an episode is done.

Eventually with enough exploring the optimal q-values are found.
